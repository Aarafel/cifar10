CIFAR-10 Image Classification
This project demonstrates image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset with a feedforward neural network.

Overview
Load Data: Uses CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing.

Visualize Data: Displays sample images and class distribution.

Preprocess Data: Flattens, normalizes images, and one-hot encodes labels.

Model: Defines a feedforward neural network with layers: 512-256-128.

Train & Evaluate: Trains the model and plots accuracy/loss curves.

Predict: Makes predictions on random test images.
